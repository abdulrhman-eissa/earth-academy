# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## MCP setup (template)

Use `/home/runner/work/earth-academy/earth-academy/.mcp.example.json` as a template and merge it into your local MCP config (for example `.mcp.json`) without removing any existing servers (such as UI/UX Pro Max).

Magic UI MCP server entry:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "magicuidesign-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@magicuidesign/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```
